# Door Controlled Hide Volumes
GM side tool that allows linking of doors to reveal/hide hide volumes when they are opened.

## Install
Currently you need to either follow the build guide down below or use the R2ModMan. 

## Usage
In GM Mode you will find an extra button in the Radial menu for Doors and Hide Volumes. First you select a door via the Radial Menu. After that you can interact with hide volume(s) and click "Show On Door open". This will link the door to the hide volume. You can remove the linking the same way but clicking "Remove Show On Door Open". By default closing doors won't hide Hide Volumes. You can enable this feature in the config for the plugin under `org.HF.plugins.HVE.cfg` - "Hide On Close" and set the value to true. By default this is false.
